# PerformanceAnalysisTopologies
Undergrad final year project on performance comparison of various interconnection network topologies.

Compare performance of various interconnection network topologies including FatTree, Mesh of Trees, HyperCube, Mesh, Torus, etc., over the parameters like latency, throughput, and packet delivery ratio using NS2 simulator. Factors impacting performance comparison includes router queue management techniques like RED, REM, SFQ, FQ, DRR, and DropTail. Performance is compared for various node configurations like 4X4, 8X8, 16X16, and so on.
